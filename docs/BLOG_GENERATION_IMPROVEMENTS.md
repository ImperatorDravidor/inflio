# Blog Generation Improvements

## Overview
Fixed the blog generation feature to produce properly formatted markdown content instead of raw HTML, and improved the overall quality of generated blogs.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Raw HTML Display**
- **Problem**: Blog content was being generated as HTML and displayed as raw text with visible HTML tags
- **Solution**: Updated the blog generation API to produce markdown content instead of HTML
- **Result**: Clean, properly rendered blog posts

### 2. **Content Rendering**
- **Problem**: ProcessingResults component was using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` expecting HTML
- **Solution**: Updated to use ReactMarkdown component with proper markdown rendering
- **Result**: Consistent markdown rendering across all blog displays

## Technical Changes

   - Timestamp formatting improved ([MM:SS] format)
   - Better SEO metadata generation
   - Added word count and reading time calculation

3. **Model Usage**:
   - Using GPT-4-turbo-preview (latest GPT-4 model)
   - Increased max tokens to 3000 for longer, more comprehensive content
   - Temperature set to 0.7 for creative yet coherent output

### UI Improvements (`src/components/processing-results.tsx`)

1. **ReactMarkdown Integration**:
   - Added ReactMarkdown with remark-gfm plugin
   - Custom component styling for consistent appearance
   - Proper prose styling with dark mode support

### SEO Optimization
- Meta title (50-60 characters)
- Meta description (150-160 characters)

## Example Output

Instead of raw HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

</head>
<body>
    <h1>Leadership Lessons from the Wizard of Oz</h1>
    <p>Content here...</p>
