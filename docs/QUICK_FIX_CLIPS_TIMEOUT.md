# 🚨 Quick Fix: Clips Generation Timeout (33% Freeze)

## The Problem
Your clip generation is freezing at "2 clips 33%" because the process is timing out while trying to:
1. Download each clip from Klap
2. Re-upload to your Supabase storage
3. This takes too long and hits Vercel's timeout limit

## ✅ Immediate Fix

### 1. Add Environment Variable

**For Local Development (.env.local)**:
```bash
SKIP_KLAP_VIDEO_REUPLOAD=true
```

**For Production (Vercel)**:
1. Go to your Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add:
   - Key: `SKIP_KLAP_VIDEO_REUPLOAD`
   - Value: `true`
   - Environment: Production (and Preview if needed)
5. Click "Save"
6. **IMPORTANT**: Redeploy your app for changes to take effect

### 2. What This Does
- ✅ Skips downloading clips from Klap
- ✅ Skips re-uploading to Supabase
- ✅ Uses Klap's direct player URLs instead
- ✅ Clips process much faster (no timeout)
- ✅ Still get all clip data and thumbnails

### 3. Verify It's Working
After adding the environment variable and redeploying:
1. Upload a new video
2. Select "AI Analysis" and "Generate Clips"
3. Watch the processing page - it should complete without freezing

## 📊 Expected Timeline
With `SKIP_KLAP_VIDEO_REUPLOAD=true`:
- 5 min video: ~10-15 minutes total
- 10 min video: ~15-20 minutes total
- 20 min video: ~20-25 minutes total

## 🎯 Long-term Solution
The code has been updated to:
1. Process clips in batches
2. Handle timeouts better
3. Default to skipping re-upload

But you still need the environment variable for now!

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Clips will be hosted on Klap's servers (not your Supabase)
- This is the recommended approach for production
- You can always export clips later if needed

## 🔧 Still Having Issues?
If it's still freezing after adding the environment variable:
1. Check your Klap API key is valid
2. Ensure you've redeployed after adding the env var
3. Try with a shorter video first (< 5 minutes)
4. Check Vercel function logs for specific errors
