# Blog Generation Voice Fix - First Person & Interview Styles

## Issue
Blog generation was producing third-person summaries ("The speaker discusses...") instead of authentic first-person thought leadership content where the creator writes as themselves.

## Solution
Enhanced the blog generation system to support two distinct voices:
1. **First-Person Thought Leader**: Write as yourself sharing expertise
2. **Interview Style**: Q&A format for videos with guests

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Blog Generation Dialog (`src/components/blog-generation-dialog.tsx`)

Added voice selection options:
```typescript
export interface BlogGenerationOptions {
  style: 'professional' | 'casual' | 'technical' | 'storytelling'
  voice: 'first-person' | 'interview'  // NEW
  guestName?: string                    // NEW for interviews
  // ... other options
}
```

New UI features:
- **Content Voice** selector with two options:
  - Thought Leader: "Write as yourself sharing expertise"
  - Interview Style: "Q&A format with a guest"
- Guest name field (appears only when interview style is selected)
- Improved layout with better visual hierarchy

### 2. Enhanced Blog Generation API (`src/app/api/generate-blog/route.ts`)

#### First-Person System Prompt:
```
You are writing AS the content creator themselves, sharing their expertise and insights in FIRST PERSON. Write as if YOU are the expert speaking directly to your audience.

Voice Guidelines:
- Use "I", "my", "we" throughout - you ARE the content creator
- Share personal insights, experiences, and expertise
- Write as a thought leader sharing valuable knowledge
- Be authentic, authoritative, and engaging
- Speak directly to YOUR audience as if you're having a conversation

CRITICAL: Write as the actual person who created the video, not as someone describing what they said. For example:
- WRONG: "The speaker discusses..." or "They explain..."
- RIGHT: "I've discovered..." or "Let me share..."
```

#### Interview Style System Prompt:
```
You are writing an interview-style blog post featuring a conversation with [Guest Name].

Interview Guidelines:
- Structure as a conversation between interviewer and guest
- Use clear Q: and A: formatting or bold names
- Capture the authentic voice and personality of both speakers
- Include natural conversational elements
- Highlight key insights and takeaways from the guest
```

### 3. Voice-Specific User Prompts

First-person prompts now use:
- "YOUR EXPERTISE/SUMMARY" instead of "SUMMARY"
- "TOPICS YOU COVER" instead of "MAIN TOPICS"
- "KEY POINTS YOU MAKE" instead of "KEY MOMENTS"
- Instructions emphasize writing AS yourself, not ABOUT yourself

## Benefits

### For Solo Content:
- Authentic thought leadership voice
- Personal connection with audience
- Positions creator as expert
- More engaging and relatable content
- Better for building personal brand

### For Interview Content:
- Natural conversational flow
- Highlights guest expertise
- Easy-to-follow Q&A format
- Captures dialogue authenticity
- Great for podcast/interview videos

## Example Output
