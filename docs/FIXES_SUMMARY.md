# Fixes Summary - Transcript Viewer & Timeout Issues

## 1. Transcript Viewer Synchronization

### What was fixed:
- **Improved scroll behavior**: The transcript now smoothly scrolls to center the active segment
- **Better synchronization**: Added support for video seeking (jumping to different times)
- **Visual feedback**: Active segments are highlighted and centered in view

### How it works:
- Transcript segments are **NOT** one word per second
- Each segment represents a chunk of speech with start/end timestamps
- As the video plays, the corresponding segment is highlighted and scrolled into view
- Clicking any segment jumps the video to that exact moment

### To use:
1. Play the video - the transcript will auto-scroll
2. Click any transcript segment to jump to that time
3. The active segment is always centered in view

## 2. Klap Processing Timeout Solution

### What was fixed:
- **No more timeouts**: Clips are saved progressively as they process
- **Intelligent handling**: System detects approaching timeout and adapts
- **On-demand downloads**: Clips downloaded to Supabase only when needed

### New Processing Flow:
1. **Initial Processing** (0-4.5 minutes)
   - Downloads clips to your Supabase storage
   - Saves each clip immediately after processing
   - No data loss even if timeout occurs

2. **Near Timeout** (4.5+ minutes)
   - Automatically switches to URL-only mode
   - Remaining clips use Klap's URLs temporarily
   - Can be downloaded later on-demand

3. **On-Demand Downloads**
   - When posting to social media, clips are downloaded if needed
   - Individual clip downloads take < 1 minute
   - Full control over your content

### Benefits:
- ✅ **No timeouts** - Processing always completes
- ✅ **Data ownership** - Clips stored in your Supabase
- ✅ **Flexibility** - Download when needed
- ✅ **Reliability** - Progressive saving prevents data loss

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/process-klap` - Process all clips (with timeout protection)
- `GET /api/process-klap?projectId={id}` - Check status/progress
- `POST /api/download-clip` - Download individual clip on-demand
- `GET /api/download-clip?clipId={id}&projectId={pid}` - Check if download needed

## Quick Start

### For Transcript Viewer:
The improvements are already active. Just use the transcript viewer as normal - it will:
- Auto-scroll during playback
- Center active segments
- Respond to clicks for navigation

### For Klap Processing:
No configuration needed! The system automatically:
1. Processes clips with timeout protection
2. Saves progressively to avoid data loss
3. Downloads on-demand for social media

### Optional Configuration:
- Set `SKIP_KLAP_VIDEO_REUPLOAD=true` in `.env` to always use Klap URLs (faster but less control)
- Default behavior (recommended) gives you the best of both worlds

## Summary
Both issues are now resolved. The transcript viewer provides smooth, intuitive synchronization with the video, and Klap processing is timeout-proof while still giving you full ownership of your clips in Supabase storage.
