# Staging Workflow Improvements

## Overview
We've significantly improved the staging workflow to make it more functional and user-friendly, especially for handling clips with pre-generated captions from Klap.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Auto-fill Captions for Clips
- **Problem**: Clips already have platform-specific captions generated by Klap, but users had to manually re-enter them in the staging interface
- **Solution**: The staging service now automatically carries forward captions from `publicationCaptions` stored in clips
- **Implementation**: 
  - Enhanced `prepareClipContent` method in staging service to map Klap captions to platform-specific fields
  - Added logic to handle different caption field names across platforms (caption, tweet, text, description)
  - Extracts hashtags from captions and stores them separately

### 2. Platform-Specific Field Mapping
- **Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook**: Use `caption` field
- **YouTube**: Uses `description` field (also adds `title` automatically)
- **X (Twitter)**: Uses `tweet` field
- **Threads**: Uses `text` field

### 3. Content Preview Feature
- **New Component**: `PlatformContentPreview` provides realistic previews of how content will appear on each platform
- **Features**:
  - Platform-specific UI mockups (Instagram feed, TikTok video, YouTube player, etc.)
  - Shows captions, hashtags, and media in context
  - Character count indicators
  - Scheduled post timestamps
- **Toggle**: Users can show/hide preview with a button in the staging interface

### 4. Enhanced Content Stager UI
- **Split View**: Form fields on the left, live preview on the right
- **Auto-population**: Captions from clips are automatically filled when selecting content
- **Task Checklist**: Shows completion status for required fields
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback on platform completion percentage
- **AI Generation**: One-click AI caption generation for platforms without pre-existing captions

## Workflow Summary

1. **Upload** → Video is uploaded and processed
2. **Processing** → Klap generates clips with platform-specific captions
3. **Project View** → User can see all generated content
4. **Publish Content** → User selects content to stage
5. **Staging** → 
   - Captions are automatically pre-filled for all platforms
   - User can preview how content will look
   - Edit captions if needed
   - AI can generate missing captions
6. **Schedule** → Set optimal posting times
7. **Review & Publish** → Final review before publishing

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/components/staging/enhanced-content-stager.tsx` - Added caption auto-fill logic and preview toggle
- `src/components/staging/platform-content-preview.tsx` - New preview component
- `src/lib/staging/staging-service.ts` - Improved caption mapping logic

### TypeScript Considerations
- Used type assertions for platform-specific fields not in base type definition
- Maintained type safety while allowing flexibility for platform variations

## Benefits
1. **Productivity**: No need to re-enter captions that were already generated
2. **Consistency**: Captions remain consistent from generation to publishing
3. **Visual Confidence**: Users can see exactly how their posts will appear
4. **Time Savings**: Significantly reduces the time needed to prepare content for multiple platforms
5. **Quality Control**: Preview feature helps catch formatting issues before publishing
