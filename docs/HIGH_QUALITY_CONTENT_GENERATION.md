### 4. **AI-Powered Intelligence**

The system:
1. **Analyzes your video** to extract the most shareable moments
2. **Identifies viral hooks** - statistics, transformations, controversial points
3. **Creates platform-specific copy** that feels native
4. **Generates visuals** that support the message, not distract from it

## How It Works

### Step 1: Content Analysis
```javascript
// AI extracts key insights from your video
const insights = await AIContentIntelligence.extractDeepInsights(
  transcription,
  contentAnalysis,
  projectTitle
)
```

### Step 2: Campaign Generation
```javascript
// Creates complete campaign with platform optimization
const campaign = await AIContentIntelligence.generateSmartCampaign(
  insights,
  projectTitle,
  contentAnalysis,
  ['instagram', 'twitter', 'linkedin']
)
```

### Step 3: Visual Creation with Text
```javascript
// Generates graphics with embedded text
const visual = await AIContentIntelligence.generateVisualConcepts(
  post,
  videoContent,
  keyInsight,
  personaPhotos
)

// Result includes:
{
  primary: "Instagram post with text 'Your Key Message Here'...",
  textOverlay: "Your Key Message Here",
  designSpecs: {
    dimensions: "1080x1080",
    textPlacement: "center with padding",
    colorScheme: "vibrant gradients"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: High-Quality Image Generation
```javascript
// Using gpt-image-1 for professional results
await fetch('/api/generate-social-graphics', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-image-1',
    quality: 'hd',
    customText: extractedQuote,
    textOverlay: true,
    // Explicit instructions for text placement
  })
})
```
