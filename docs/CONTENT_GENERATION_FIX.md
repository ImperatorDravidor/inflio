# Content Generation Fix - AI Caption Generation

## Issue
When clicking "AI Generate" in the content preparation/copywriting interface, users were getting a generic "Failed to generate AI content" error.

## Root Causes
1. **Invalid Model Name**: The API was using `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` which doesn't exist
2. **Missing OpenAI API Key**: The error handling wasn't clear about missing API configuration
3. **Poor Error Messaging**: Generic error messages didn't help users understand the issue

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Model Name
Changed from the non-existent model to the standard GPT-4o model:
```typescript
// Before
model: 'gpt-4.1-2025-04-14'

// After  
model: 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06'
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added specific error checking for OpenAI initialization
- Improved error messages to be more descriptive
- Added console logging for debugging

### 3. Better User Feedback
- Error messages now show the actual error instead of generic "Failed to generate"
- Added specific messages for missing API key configuration

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Set OpenAI API Key
Create or update your `.env.local` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

### 2. Get Your API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy and paste it into your `.env.local` file

### 3. Test Your Configuration
Run the test script:
```bash
node scripts/test-openai-config.js
```

This will verify:
- API key is set
- API key is valid
- Connection to OpenAI works

### 4. Restart Your Development Server
After setting the API key, restart your Next.js server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
- Check that `.env.local` exists in your project root
- Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set and not the placeholder value
- Restart your development server after adding the key

### "401 Unauthorized"
- Your API key is invalid or expired
- Create a new key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### "429 Rate Limit"
- You've exceeded your usage quota
- Check usage at https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan
