## Outstanding Issues

### 1. High Priority

#### Console Statements in Production
- **Issue:** 200+ console.log/error statements found across the codebase
- **Impact:** Performance degradation, security risks
- **Recommendation:** Systematically replace all console statements with logger calls
- **Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

#### Empty TODO Comments
- **Issue:** Multiple TODO comments without implementation
- **Files Affected:** 
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/templates/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/social/calendar/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/projects/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Recommendation:** Create tasks to address each TODO or remove if no longer relevant

#### TypeScript Any Usage
- **Issue:** Excessive use of `any` type reduces type safety
- **Impact:** Potential runtime errors, reduced IDE support
- **Recommendation:** Replace with proper types or unknown where appropriate

### 2. Medium Priority

#### Large Component Files
- **Issue:** Project page component is 3000+ lines
- **Impact:** Slow initial load, difficult maintenance
- **Recommendation:** Split into smaller, focused components

#### Missing Tests
- **Issue:** No unit or integration tests
- **Impact:** Risk of regressions, harder refactoring
- **Recommendation:** Add tests for critical paths

#### Bundle Size Optimization
- **Issue:** Large JavaScript bundles
- **Recommendation:** Implement code splitting and lazy loading

### 3. Low Priority

#### Accessibility Improvements
- **Issue:** Missing ARIA labels on some interactive elements
- **Recommendation:** Conduct accessibility audit and add proper labels

#### API Documentation
- **Issue:** No OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Recommendation:** Document all API endpoints
