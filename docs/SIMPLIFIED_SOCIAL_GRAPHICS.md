# Simplified Social Graphics - Functional Implementation

## Problem

The original implementation had **5 confusing modes** that didn't work properly:
- Create
- AI Assist  
- Campaign
- Premium
- Generate Social Graphics button

This created a confusing user experience with too many non-functional options.

## Solution

Simplified to just **2 clear modes** that actually work:

### 1. **Manual Graphics Mode**
- Create custom graphics one at a time
- Full control over design and text
- Uses the existing `SocialGraphicsGenerator` component
- Perfect for specific branding needs

### 2. **AI Campaign Mode**  
- Analyzes your video with GPT-4.1
- Generates 6-9 social media posts automatically
- Creates graphics with gpt-image-1
- Every post references the original video
