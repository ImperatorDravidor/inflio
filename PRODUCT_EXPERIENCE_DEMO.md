Hi Alec,

We are trending in a good direction! I am excited to see how the new editing changes do this coming month. 
I am noticing a trend, on LinkedIn specifically, that people enjoy your posts when they are more natural 
and "in the wild" or about your life. I would love to start posting more organic stuff on there for you...
