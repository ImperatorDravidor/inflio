- [ ] Check for other temp directories
- [ ] Final root directory review

### Phase 6: Final Testing & Documentation
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

## 💡 Tips for Continuing

1. **Work in sessions** - Don't try to do everything at once
2. **Test frequently** - Run build after each major change
3. **Commit often** - Small, atomic commits are safer
4. **Document as you go** - Update this file after each session
5. **Take breaks** - This is a multi-day project by design

## 🤝 Need Help?

**If something breaks**:
1. Check git status: `git status`
2. Review last commit: `git log -1`
3. Rollback if needed: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
4. Or restore from backup: `git checkout backup-before-cleanup-20251202-220606`

**Before asking for help**:
- Read the relevant analysis document
- Check error messages carefully
- Try the verification commands
- Review the safety checklist

**Remember**: This is about making the codebase maintainable, not rushing to completion.
Take your time, test thoroughly, and document your decisions.
